        It's precious to have a friend with whom you can share your day, happiness and sadness and with whom you want to talk to everyday.
        I am lucky to have found that friend in you. You are one of the few person that have brought a smile on Mr Gupta's face even when he was super tensed. I hope I can also do same for you someday.
        I wish you happy as well as healthy wealthy present and future!
        It's my privilege to know you. Wish you a very Happy happy birthday !
